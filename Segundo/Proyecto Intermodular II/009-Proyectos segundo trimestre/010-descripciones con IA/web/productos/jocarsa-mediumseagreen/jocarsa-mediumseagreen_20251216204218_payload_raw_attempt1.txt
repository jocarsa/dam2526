It looks like you've shared the directory structure and contents of a project that seems to be related to educational content, specifically for SMR (Sistema de Modulación y Reprogramación) and DAM (Desarrollo Aplicaciones Multiplataforma) courses. Here's an overview of what I see:

### Directory Structure
1. **Root Directory:**
   - `index.php`
   - `listas.json`
   - `mediumseagreen.png`, `mediumseagreenfondo.png`, `mediumseagreenfondoblur.png`: These seem to be images for styling.
   - `estilo.css`: CSS file for styling.
   - `playlists_videos.json`: JSON file likely containing video playlist information.

2. **Scripts:**
   - `101-descargatranscripciones.py` and `102-matchsemantico.py`: Python scripts possibly related to downloading transcripts or matching semantic content.
   - `transcripts_25_26`: Directory containing transcripts and their corresponding `.vtt` files for videos from September 11, 2025, to September 18, 2025.

3. **Mensajes (Messages):**
   - Several text files with dates in the filenames likely contain messages or announcements for specific dates.

4. **Resumenes (Summaries):** Directory that might contain summary files of some sort.

5. **Temarios (Syllabi):**
   - Syllabi for DAM1 and DAM2 courses, organized into directories for each course.
   - Files in these directories are `.md` (Markdown) files likely containing detailed syllabus information for the respective courses.

6. **Mensajes (Messages):** Directory that contains message files with announcements or updates from the classes.

### Key Components
- **Transcripts and Videos:** The `transcripts_25_26` directory contains `.vtt` video transcript files, which are used to display subtitles on videos.
- **Python Scripts:** These scripts might be involved in downloading these transcripts and potentially processing them for semantic analysis or other purposes.

### Potential Workflow
1. **Transcript Downloading:**
   - `101-descargatranscripciones.py` could be a script that downloads video transcripts from YouTube (or another platform) and saves them as `.vtt` files.
2. **Processing Transcripts:**
   - `102-matchsemantico.py` might process these transcripts to match semantic content, possibly for summarization or other NLP tasks.

### Next Steps
- If you're looking to extend this project:
  - Ensure that the Python scripts are well-documented.
  - Consider adding error handling and logging in the scripts.
  - You could add a web interface to display summaries, syllabi, and announcements.
  - Automate the process of downloading new transcripts or updating existing ones.

### Questions
- Are there specific functionalities you're looking for help with?
- Do you need assistance setting up a backend or frontend for this project?
- What are your current challenges in managing these scripts or files?
